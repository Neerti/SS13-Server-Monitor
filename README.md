# Intro
A utility program written in python using the libtcod library.  Warning: Contains spaghetti code.

The main program main.py requires
libtcod-1.5.1. which can be freely downloaded at:
http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/download/

# Using
The utility is able to support servers using all major codebases (Baycode, /tg/ code, even gooncode surprisingly).
Features may be missing if using the program that isn't using baycode.

To connect to a server, type '1', type in the IP, then type '2' and type in the port, and press enter.
The program will query the server every ten minutes.  If you are lost, press '?' for a list of buttons to press.
